title: "RemixKit — the artist console"
subtitle: "The application PRODUCT.md describes: register an artist, build their identity once, attach songs, generate content designed to be imitated, and verify what came out."
status: "LIVE — deployed on AWS with real generation, real B2, and real auth. Also runs end-to-end with zero credentials."
date: "2026-07-27"
---

## Run it

No credentials, no bucket, no API keys, no database.

```bash
cd app
python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -e ".[dev]"
.venv/bin/uvicorn remixkit.main:app --reload
```

Everything the app needs is read from `app/.env` — including `RK_SSM_PATH`, which is how
real credentials arrive. Nothing needs exporting first: `source .env` would not work
anyway, because a plain `KEY=value` line sets a shell variable rather than an exported
one, so a child process never sees it.

Open <http://localhost:8000/console>. Register an artist, record likeness consent, save
an identity, attach a song, set its hook window, generate a kit. Real videos appear.

<http://localhost:8000> is the public landing page — the B2B site, served by this same
app, and the only page that renders without a session. See [Two front doors](#two-front-doors).

`ffmpeg` is the one non-Python dependency (`brew install ffmpeg`). Without it the mock
generator reports the modality unavailable rather than producing something misleading.

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest        # 67 tests, ~2s
```

## What "mock" does and does not mean

This matters more than it usually would, because a demo that looks live while it is
mocked misleads by accident.

**Real:** the Genblaze `Pipeline`, the `ObjectStorageSink`, the `HIERARCHICAL` key
layout, content hashing, the manifest, `manifest.verify()`, the cost ledger, and the
embed-on-delivery path. **Synthetic:** the pixels, which ffmpeg generates, and the unit
costs, which come from a table.

The consequence worth stating: *the manifest verified on a laptop is produced by the
same code that produces the one in B2.* Switching to real providers changes
`RK_GENERATOR_BACKEND` and nothing else.

Every page carries a banner naming which backends are live, and `/healthz` returns the
same thing as JSON.

## Shape

Hexagonal, so that "componentized, and we add auth later" is a configuration change
rather than a refactor.

`analysis` and `transcription` are the two axes with no mock — the only two where a

thing. See below.

## Songs have as many hooks as they have

A song used to carry one `hook` window, which said every track has exactly one loopable
moment. `Song.sections` replaces that: a list of named stretches — intro, verse, chorus,
drop, breakdown — of which any tagged hook, chorus or drop can be cut to. A kit may be cut
to several, and each loop is the length of *its own* window. The videos are dealt
round-robin across the chosen hooks rather than multiplied by them, so ticking a second
hook does not double the invoice without the video count being changed too.

One window is still the *primary* hook, mirrored onto `song.hook`, and it is what a kit
cuts to when its brief names no section. Setting it on the old form moves the section, so
the two surfaces cannot disagree about what will render.

**Every section records where its window came from.** `measured` carries the analyser's
method line; `manual` means somebody drew it. Moving a measured window makes it manual and
keeps the old method as history — a window a person dragged still reading "measured" would
be the provenance rule defeated by the edit form.

## Measuring the master

Upload an MP3 or WAV on the song page and the structure is measured from the audio:
tempo, the drop, the riser, the plateau, and the sections. The bytes go browser→bucket
(§2b rule 2) and the measurement runs as a queued job (§2b rule 3), inline on a laptop and
on Batch in the deployment — `python worker.py --song-id sng_…`.

The methods are not new. `content/RHYTHM-STUDY.md` measured one song to death and recorded
which approaches work on this material and which do not, and `adapters/audio_numpy.py` is
a port of the two tools that study validated:

| | how, and why not the standard move |
|---|---|
| tempo | joint tempo+phase comb fit. Autocorrelation alone gives a good period and a phase that wanders. |
| drop | largest positive step in sub-200 Hz energy. Foote checkerboard novelty ranked the study's measured drop 8th–79th, never 1st — a drop is a *re-entry*, which a checkerboard scores low. |
| bar line | the residue mod 4 of the largest arrangement changes. On four-on-the-floor an accent comb has no signal: four phases within 5–9%, disagreeing about the winner. |
| section end | the first bar whose kick falls past 3× the typical bar-to-bar movement. A mastered drop is limited, so RMS barely moves at a boundary while the low band falls off a cliff. |

`tests/test_audio_numpy.py` runs it against the study's own master and asserts the study's
own published numbers — 125 BPM, the drop at 124784 ms, an 8-beat riser, a 28-beat
plateau, 5 of 6 changes sharing a residue. A port that does not reproduce the original's
findings on the original's material is a different algorithm wearing its docstrings.

**There is no mock analyser, and that asymmetry is deliberate.** Every other adapter has a
zero-credential version that does the real thing badly; a mocked measurement is a float
that nothing downstream — not the console, not a kit brief, not a person reading the song
six months later — could distinguish from a measured one. So a process without numpy
refuses and names what is missing, on the song page and in the `/healthz` warnings.

```bash
pip install -e '.[audio]'     # numpy; ffmpeg on PATH for anything but a WAV
```

## Reading the words off it

The other question the same master answers. Analysis says *where the hooks are*;
transcription says *what is being sung in them* — and it runs the same way, as a queued job
over the stored bytes: `python worker.py --transcribe-song-id sng_…`, inline on a laptop,
Batch in the deployment.

ElevenLabs Scribe, direct rather than through Genblaze: `genblaze-elevenlabs` generates
speech and this is the other direction, with no generator step to hang it on. The key is
the one `adapters/providers.py` already reads for TTS, so a keyed deployment gains this
without gaining a vendor.

**A lyric is a guess at language, and the console never pretends otherwise.** The provider
returns words; a lyric is lines, so `adapters/lyrics_elevenlabs.py` groups them on three
stated thresholds — a 900 ms gap, 42 characters, sentence-final punctuation — and every one
of them is in the `method` line stored on the song. Each line carries the geometric mean of
its words' probabilities, and the ones below 0.6 are flagged **check by ear** rather than
hidden: they are the list of lines to play back, and burying them would make a transcript
look finished when the whole point of the number is that it is not.

**Every line is editable, and editing one records that a person did.** Same rule as a
section window: a transcribed line somebody rewrote becomes `manual`, keeps the old method
as history, and *loses the confidence* — a machine's doubt attached to a sentence a human
decided would be the provenance rule defeated by the edit form. Fixing a chorus the model
heard as gibberish is one textarea, not eight round trips: the bulk edit keeps the windows
already known by pairing lines positionally, leaves untouched lines measured, and says so
when the line count moves and the pairing becomes a guess.

Re-transcribing **replaces** the lyric — a lyric is one continuous reading, so interleaving
old corrections with new lines produces a transcript that is neither. A song with
hand-corrected lines therefore refuses the second run and says how many would be lost;
`force` is the caller saying yes anyway, and the console asks before sending it.

**There is no mock transcriber**, for a sharper version of the analyser's argument. A
fabricated measurement is a wrong number; a fabricated lyric is *words attributed to an
artist* — stored as the song's own, offered to the generate form as hook lines, and burned
into a clip published under the label's name. A lyric can still be typed by hand on a
process with no credentials, which is what a label with the sheet already wants anyway.

```bash
pip install -e '.[lyrics]'    # the ElevenLabs SDK; ELEVENLABS_API_KEY to actually run
```

## Recommendations, and what they are not

The song page ranks the hooks and says why. It is **not** a predictor of what performs —
BUILD-SPEC §7 lists that under what this project deliberately does not build, and nothing
in `services/recommendations.py` came from a model.

It is RHYTHM-STUDY §9's candidate rules, which that study wrote down and noted are "none of
these is enforced today", applied to a measured song: a loop starts on a bar line, spans a
whole number of bars, fits inside the measured plateau, and lands in the 3–10 s window the
renderer will actually cut. Each rule reports pass, fail, or **not checkable** — the third
state matters, because rendering "no measurement for this rule" as a failure sends someone
to fix a window that may well be right.

Every card carries its basis: the measurement the recommendation rests on. A song with
nothing measured gets the list of what is missing instead of a ranking of guesses, and
there is no weighted total anywhere — a single score would read as a quality judgement,
which is exactly the claim §5 shows this material cannot support.

## Which provider actually runs

`RK_GENERATOR_BACKEND=genblaze` selects the live path; *which* provider serves each
modality is then decided by what is installed, what is actually keyed, and any pin.

| Modality | Deployed today | Order when unpinned |
|---|---|---|
| Video | **Sora** (`sora-2`) — pinned | GMI Cloud → OpenAI → Google |
| Image | **GMI Cloud** (`seedream-5.0-lite`) | GMI Cloud → OpenAI → Google |
| Audio | **ElevenLabs** (`eleven_multilingual_v2`) | ElevenLabs → OpenAI |

A modality nobody serves is skipped with a warning rather than failing the run, because
a partial provider set is the normal state.

**Video is pinned, and the pin is the point.** `RK_VIDEO_PROVIDER=openai` moves video to
Sora even though GMI is keyed and would otherwise win. On 2026-07-31 GMI's `seedance-2`
failed twice after ~174s and billed for output it never produced; the fix had to be a
deploy-time setting rather than an edit, because a provider misbehaving in production is
an operational event, not a code change. Image stayed on GMI, which is cheap and works.
A pin naming an unavailable vendor logs a warning and falls through to the order above —
a typo in an environment variable should degrade, not silently delete video from a kit.

**The model follows the provider, not the config.** `RK_VIDEO_MODEL` and friends default
to empty; each provider names the model it actually serves in
`adapters/providers.DEFAULT_MODELS`. They used to default to GMI slugs, which was correct
only while GMI was the only live provider — the moment anything else answered, a
`seedance-…` id was being sent to Sora or Veo, which is a guaranteed 404. Set one to pin
a model, and it applies to whoever answers.

**"Keyed" excludes the placeholder.** Terraform seeds each SSM parameter with a literal
`PLACEHOLDER …` string so the slot exists before anyone has a key — Terraform must never
hold the value itself, or it lands in state in plaintext. `providers._keyed()` treats
that string as unset, because `GMICloudVideoProvider()` constructs happily with no
credential and would otherwise report a **live** generator that fails at generate time.

**Providers are baked into the image, not installed at deploy.** `Dockerfile` installs
`.[b2,queue,audio,gmicloud,openai,elevenlabs,lyrics]`. This is stated because getting it
wrong is invisible: the image once shipped with `.[b2,queue,audio]` only, so
`live_providers()` returned `{}` and every shot was skipped — and because the Dockerfile
set `RK_GENERATOR_BACKEND=genblaze` while the Lambda environment overrode it to `mock`,
the missing dependency read as a credentials problem for weeks. `google` is deliberately
excluded: Vertex authenticates with Application Default Credentials, which do not exist
in Lambda or a Fargate task, so shipping it would add weight for a provider that cannot
authenticate there.

---

## What a run costs, and why that is a module

`adapters/pricing.py` is one dated price book, registered into Genblaze's own
`ModelRegistry`. It exists because both of the numbers this app used to show were wrong,
in opposite directions, and neither was a bug in the ordinary sense:

* Genblaze registers **no prices of its own** — "the SDK ships zero hardcoded prices as
  of 0.3.0" — so `step.cost_usd` is `None` for every unregistered model. The generator
  coerced that to `0`, and a multi-dollar run reported a `$0.00` ledger.
* A separate flat table priced a *modality* rather than a *model* and ignored duration,
  so every video cost 42¢ regardless. A three-video kit quoted $1.26 and charged several
  dollars.

One registered book fixes all three: `Pipeline.estimated_cost()` becomes real, the ledger
becomes real, and the two cannot drift because they read the same rates. A model with no
registered price estimates at `UNKNOWN_CALL_USD` rather than free — unknown pricing as
zero is exactly how the original problem stayed invisible — and `cost_cents` is now
`int | None`, so "unknown" and "free" are different claims on the ledger.

`RK_MAX_RUN_CENTS` refuses a run whose estimate exceeds the ceiling, **before** anything
is submitted. Genblaze documents no spend guardrail, and says nothing about whether a
failed step is billed; the observed answer is that it is. So the only safe assumption is
that a submitted step is a charged step, and the only safe place to refuse is before
submission.

## Seeing the run before buying it

`/console/artists/{id}/songs/{id}/generate` is a dry run. It resolves the whole brief to
per-shot wire payloads — the model that would answer, the composed prompt as the provider
receives it, the negatives, the duration after snapping, and the price — and sends nothing.

The property that makes it worth reading is that there is **one resolution path**.
`GenblazeGenerator._resolve()` builds the payloads; `plan()` displays them and `generate()`
submits them. Not two implementations kept in step by hand — one function with two callers.

That mattered on 2026-07-31. A kit for "Un Poquito Más" came back as a stock night drive
scored with a lofi instrumental the model wrote itself, and nothing had failed. The plan
table showed `Vertical 9:16 loop, moody night drive…`, which was the *mood fragment* —
truncated at ninety characters, before the identity is prepended. The string on the wire
named no song, no artist, and no constraint against audio, and no screen in the product
displayed it. Three separate defects were invisible because the payload was.

Every prompt on the screen is editable and pre-filled with what would be sent. Edits are
re-priced on the server, carried onto the queue button, stored on the kit as
`brief["shot_overrides"]`, and replayed by the worker — so what was previewed is what runs.
Clearing a field restores the generated default rather than sending an empty prompt.

Three cheaper-than-live paths exist beyond it: `RK_GENERATOR_BACKEND=mock` renders real
files and a real manifest with synthetic pixels for nothing; a proxy-frame tier and step
caching are specified but not built. See `PIPELINE-SPEC.md` for both, and for the node
model that replaces the four hardcoded moods.

### The identity builder

One surface, at `/console/artists/{id}/identity`. It used to be three: the builder page,
which split "Description" from "Reference frames" across a tab switch, plus a second full
copy of the form on the artist page. Saving mints a version, so two open screens could each
mint a version over the other from forms that were both current when they rendered — and
the tab split put the words describing a face on one pane and the photographs of that face
on another, which made "do these agree" the one question the layout prevented.

The artist page now shows a read-only summary and links here.

**Three columns, and depth for the rest.** The page has three jobs on screen at once —
what the model is told, what it is shown, and what has been said before — and they are only
useful together, so stacking them into one scroll defeated the merge that put them on one
page. The compiled prompt pins to the bottom of the column that produces it. Uploading
opens a modal, a still opens a lightbox, version history opens a drawer.

Those are native `<dialog>` elements: the browser owns focus trapping, Escape, the top
layer, and making the page behind inert, which is four things that are tedious to hand-roll
and easy to get subtly wrong. The glue is about ten lines of event delegation. `console.css`
declares a five-step elevation scale (`--z-sticky` … `--z-lightbox`) and every `z-index` in
the file is one of them — a test asserts no bare integers, because the failure mode of
stacking is invisible until two things collide and the fix is a bigger number, forever.

**A turntable, not a contact sheet.** The reference set renders as one image at full size
with a 3×3 grid of hotspots over it, so moving the pointer turns the head: horizontal
movement rotates, and the top row is the far side. A grid of thumbnails asks you to
assemble a person out of six pictures in your own head; the turntable does the assembling,
which turns "do these look like the same human" from something you reason about into
something you see. That is the question a reference set has to answer before it is worth
conditioning on, and nothing in the console asked it.

An uncovered class shows a gap panel rather than nothing — so a missing back-of-head is
*felt*, as the head refusing to turn, instead of being findable only by reading a count.
It is pure CSS: the hotspots sit before the stage in the DOM and `:has()` does the reveal,
because a sibling combinator only looks forward and building it the intuitive way round
(pictures first) is exactly what would have needed JavaScript.

**Several faces per artist.** An `Artist` is a roster entry, and a band is one entry with
four faces in it. `Identity.name` is the *line*; versions count within their line, so a
band's second member starts at v1 rather than being numbered after somebody else's
revisions. The empty name is the primary line — what every solo artist has and what every
identity stored before the field existed is — and `current()` with no name still returns
it, so adding a member cannot silently change whose face existing kits render. Asking for a
line that has no versions returns `None` rather than substituting a different person, which
is the one substitution that must never happen.

**Full CRUD.** Frames can be removed, not just added — a mis-classified upload used to be
permanent, and a profile filed as a front kept winning the one conditioning slot for every
kit afterwards. Versions can be approved, deleted, and restored. Restoring *copies forward*
rather than rewinding: a version rewound in place would leave a kit generated last week
pointing at a version number whose content had since changed underneath it.

Two deletion rules follow from that and are easy to get wrong. Removing a frame deletes its
object only if no other frame in the identity shares the key — the key is the content digest
alone, so one photograph filed under two classes is two rows sharing one object. Deleting a
*version* deletes only the objects no surviving version references, because restore copies
frames forward by reference. Without either rule nothing errors: the rows remain and the
images 404, which is the shape of data loss that is hardest to notice.

**The description is standardised where it can be.** Presentation, build and height are
enums picked from chips and a row of drawn silhouettes rather than typed as prose. The
silhouettes are parameterised — three half-widths per build, scaled by presentation — so
the whole picker is one macro and a table of numbers rather than fifteen drawings. There is
one radio per build with the drawing swapped underneath it, because a set of radios per
presentation loses the selection the moment presentation changes.

Presentation rather than gender, deliberately: what conditions a render is silhouette and
styling, neither of which is recoverable from a demographic field, and this is a record of
how an artist presents in their own work rather than a claim the label is making about
them. `unspecified` is the default and contributes nothing to a prompt.

**Reference frames are classed.** Six angles — three-quarter left/right, front, profile
left/right, back — crossed with the lighting label that already existed. The frames grid
groups by class and shows every class including the empty ones, because a flat grid answers
"how many" and hides the only question that matters, which is which views are covered.

**And the whole thing is bounded.** See below.

### The prompt budget

`Identity.compile()` renders the identity into at most `PROMPT_BUDGET` characters (220),
ordered by salience — silhouette, then face structure, then wardrobe — and drops clauses
*whole* when they do not fit. `prompt_fragment()` is `compile()`, so the budget is a
property of the run rather than a decoration on a screen.

This is the compression argument, and it is a real failure mode rather than tidiness. A
prompt is a fixed budget of attention; every character the identity spends is one the shot
does not get. An identity written as three paragraphs pushes "vertical 9:16 loop, clean
centre frame left empty" far enough down the string that the model renders a portrait
instead of a backdrop — and that reads like the shot description was ignored, because
effectively it was.

Clauses drop whole because a prompt ending in `high cheekb` is worse than one that never
mentioned cheekbones: a fragment is not less information, it is a different instruction.
Ordering is truncation policy — silhouette survives anything, wardrobe goes first, since
wardrobe is the most likely to be overridden by the shot and the cheapest to lose.

The builder shows the compiled string, its length against the budget, and a count of what
was refused. An identity that silently loses its wardrobe every render is one somebody will
keep editing without understanding why nothing changes.

Reference frames cost nothing against this budget, which is the trade the screen is trying
to make obvious: detail that will not fit in the text belongs in a photograph.

### Holding the artist's face

`Identity.reference_frames` had been on the model since it was written, and nothing read
it — `_compose_prompt` was text-only, so a label that photographed an artist across four
lighting setups was buying video conditioned on a sentence. The frames now go to the
provider as an actual image.

`Identity.plates()` picks which ones: exact duplicates dropped by content hash, then one
frame per lighting setup, hashed frames preferred. Ordinary bookkeeping, no new dependency,
and pure — so the plan screen can call it on every render. Upload as many stills as you
like; variety across *setups* is what makes the chosen plate generalise, which is what
`ReferenceFrame.lighting` has always been for.

A video shot takes exactly **one** plate, and that is a correctness limit rather than a
budget: Seedance routes a second image into `last_frame`, which the model reads as "end the
clip here" and interpolates towards. Lyric cards take none — a face reference on a
typographic plate gives you a portrait with words over it.

Three things will stop a plate being sent, and the plan screen names whichever applies
rather than going quiet:

- **The provider refuses image inputs.** GMI and Sora declare `accepts_chain_input=True`;
  Veo and Imagen declare neither, and Genblaze raises before *any* step runs — so an
  ungated plate fails the whole kit, not one shot.
- **Storage does not serve public URLs.** The provider fetches the image from its own
  network, and `LocalStorage` presigns to `/files/…`, an app route that means nothing
  off-host. A live backend on local storage refuses instead of sending a dead link. The
  mock generator fetches nothing and is exempt, which is what keeps this path exercised on
  a laptop.
- **The identity has no frames.** Text-only, and it says so instead of looking conditioned.

### The identity lock — getting the artist, not a description of them

A video model conditioned on text drifts across the clip: the face at second six is not
the face at second one, because nothing anchors it. A video model conditioned on a *first
frame* is anchored — it inherits the identity rather than re-deriving it.

So a loop is rendered in two stages. Stage one is a still, conditioned on the artist's
reference plates, costing roughly a fifteenth of the clip. Stage two is the clip, generated
from that still via `input_from`, which lands in Seedance's `first_frame`. The expensive,
uncertain part happens once, cheaply, where a person can look at it and regenerate until it
is right.

A locked clip carries **no** plates of its own. Seedance's slots are positional, so a clip
handed both the still and the raw reference has two different images in `first_frame` and
`last_frame`, and is being asked to interpolate between them rather than to hold a face.

The lock degrades rather than failing: no image provider, no reference frames, or a
provider that refuses image inputs, and you get a plain plate-conditioned clip with the
reason on the plan row. `input_from` is validated under the same capability rule as
`external_inputs`, so a provider that refuses images refuses the still too — building one
anyway would render and bill a frame whose only consumer then kills the run.

Both stages are priced. The plan header shows shots *and* provider calls, because a
two-stage shot is one thing you bought and two things you are charged for.

**How far this goes.** Four techniques produce a recognisable person; only two are reachable
from this stack. The two-stage lock is built. Multi-reference conditioning is plumbed but
needs a verified payload key (below). Character fine-tuning has no training API on any of
the five installed connectors. Face swap has no model in the GMI registry — the image
families are inpainting and image-to-image edit — and would mean `inswapper`-class weights
on our own compute against the delivered MP4. `PIPELINE-SPEC.md` §6b has the full table.

### `RK_REFERENCE_SLOT`

Sending several reference frames in one call is the standard zero-shot way to hold a
likeness, and the frames are already collected and classed. The plumbing is built. The
missing piece is a fact about the vendor, not about this code.

Genblaze routes any number of images — `route_images(array_slot=…)` works. What it cannot
know is the key a given model expects them under, and GMI ships no per-model payload
schema: every image model resolves through a fallback declaring `route_images(slots=
("image",))`, one positional slot, and the mapper's documented behaviour for the rest is
*"If `array_slot` is None, extras are dropped."*

So one reference is the only count this code can honestly claim, and that is the default.
Inventing a key here gives you a 400, or — much worse — a kit that reports four references,
is billed for one, and looks conditioned.

Set `RK_REFERENCE_SLOT` once you have checked the model's actual payload in GMI's
catalogue. The whole classed plate set then goes, and the slot name and count are written
into the step metadata, so a wrong guess is visible in the run's own record rather than
only in a face that came back looking like someone else.

### Silent loops

A kit loop is a backdrop the master plays over, so a generated soundtrack is a defect.
Video shots carry `music, soundtrack, singing, speech, …` as `negative_prompt` and a
`silent footage` clause in the prompt.

**This is best-effort, and the console should not be read as promising more.**
`negative_prompt` is a conditioning signal, and no provider here documents it as binding on
the audio track — Veo, Sora 2 and Seedance all return video with a native audio track by
default. The deterministic fix is to drop the track on delivery (`ffmpeg -c copy -an`, a
container rewrite rather than a re-encode); it is specified in `PIPELINE-SPEC.md` §4 and not
yet built.

## Two front doors

```

/verify              provenance checking — public, on purpose
/auth/login          the sign-in card

Two routes sit outside `/console`, and both are deliberate: `/` is the marketing page,
and `/verify` is public because PRODUCT.md keeps it usable by a judge with no account.
It reads no tenant data — `manifest.verify()` runs over uploaded bytes. It is *not* at
`/console/verify`, because a URL under that prefix promises a session check that this
handler does not perform.

`/` is the marketing site (`ui/templates/pages/landing.html`, moved here from `web/`)
and it is the **only** page whose route does not take `CurrentPrincipal`. That is the
entire gate: every console handler asks for a principal, so every console handler
refuses without a session, and no route contains an `if authenticated` branch.

It is one app rather than two because `web/README.md` costed the alternative: a separate
front end is a second deploy target, a second dependency tree, and a $20/mo Vercel
commercial-ToS seat — the whole always-on floor of this stack, spent on a page that
never re-renders. The page needed no rework to move; it was already valid Jinja.

The nav swaps **Sign in** for **Open console** when the `rk_session` cookie verifies, so
an operator who is already signed in is not sent to a login form that would bounce them
straight back out again.

## Authentication: passwordless email codes

`RK_AUTH_BACKEND` selects a provider. `none` (the default) is `AnonymousAuth` — a
complete implementation that admits everyone, so a fresh checkout has no login to get
past. `otp` is the real one: a six-digit code by email, exchanged for a signed session.

```
POST /api/v1/auth/request-code   {"email": "…"}          → emails a code
POST /api/v1/auth/verify-code    {"email": …, "code": …} → {"token": "…"}
GET  /api/v1/auth/me             Authorization: Bearer … → the principal
```

The console uses the same tokens through an httpOnly `rk_session` cookie set at
`/auth/login`. One `AuthError` handler in `main.py` decides what a failure looks like:
a browser is redirected to the login page with `?next=` preserved, an htmx request gets
`HX-Redirect`, and a script gets 401 JSON. No route contains an auth branch.

Turning it on:

```bash
RK_AUTH_BACKEND=otp
RK_MAIL_BACKEND=zeptomail
RK_ALLOWED_EMAILS=you@agfarms.dev,colleague@agfarms.dev   # this IS the user table
RK_SESSION_SECRET=$(python -c 'import secrets;print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))')
RK_ZEPTOMAIL_TOKEN=…                                      # = the SMTP password
RK_MAIL_FROM=rtp@agfarms.dev                              # a verified ZeptoMail sender
```

Four choices worth knowing about, each with a defensible opposite — the reasoning is in
`services/accounts.py`:

* **Allowlist, no registration.** `RK_ALLOWED_EMAILS` decides who exists. It is checked
  when a code is requested, when it is verified, *and* on every session read, so
  removing someone ends their session at their next request rather than at its expiry.
* **A refused address is told so**, rather than silently accepting. This leaks
  membership, which is the right trade when the population is a handful of known
  colleagues and the real failure is someone mistyping their own address.
* **Sessions are stateless** — a signed token, not a row. So there is no revocation
  before expiry; the TTL is a week, and the panic button is rotating
  `RK_SESSION_SECRET`, which signs everyone out at once.
* **Codes are stored hashed** (HMAC, keyed by email), single-use, ten-minute window,
  five attempts, thirty-second resend floor.

With no mailer configured the code goes to the server log and — *only* in `RK_ENV=dev` —
back to the caller, so the whole flow is completable on a laptop with no credentials.
Both conditions are required: either alone would be an authentication bypass on a
misconfigured deployment.

Two guards, both refusing to start rather than warning: `RK_REQUIRE_AUTH=true` with
`RK_AUTH_BACKEND=none`, and `RK_REQUIRE_AUTH=true` with an empty `RK_SESSION_SECRET`
(which would otherwise sign sessions with a key that changes every restart).

In prod these are Terraform variables rather than a `.env`, and
`infra/terraform/envs/prod/variables.tf` now defaults to `auth_backend = "otp"` and
`require_auth = true`. Put `SESSION_SECRET` and `ZEPTOMAIL_TOKEN` into SSM **before**
the first apply — with `require_auth` on, a missing signing key is a function that does
not boot, which is the intended failure but an opaque one if you were not expecting it.

What made this cheap: every request already resolved a `Principal`, and every document,
object key, and job payload already carried its `tenant_id`. Adding auth was one
provider, one service, one page, and one exception handler — no service, no existing
template, and no storage key changed shape.

## The two refusals

Both are product features rather than validation, so both are in the service layer and
both are tested.

**No likeness consent, no kit.** A kit holds the artist's face invariant across every
shot, and that needs recorded, auditable rights. PRODUCT.md gap #3 inverted for this
use case: `nate-test` kept a face *out* of all 22 frames because rights were unknown; a
label generating content about its own signed artists wants the opposite. Withdrawal is
as easy as granting and takes effect on the next kit, not retroactively.

**No BPM without a method.** FORMAT-SPEC requires the provenance of a measurement.
PRODUCT.md names catalogue onboarding — not compute — as the real bottleneck; a field
that silently accepts an unsourced `128` hides that instead of measuring it.

---

## Provenance

The claim is "disclosure travels inside the file", and it is tested as a loop
(`tests/test_provenance.py`):

1. Generate a kit → assets + manifest land in the bucket, `manifest.verify()` gates
   the kit to `ready`. An unverified manifest fails the kit rather than shipping a
   claim we cannot back.
2. `GET /api/v1/kits/{id}/assets/{id}/download` → the delivered copy has the run's
   manifest **embedded in the media**, and says so in `X-RemixKit-Provenance`.
3. `POST /api/v1/verify` with that file → `verified: true`, `source: "embedded"`, plus
   the provider, model, and prompt of every step. Nothing is looked up.

The stored object stays byte-identical to what the provider returned — that is what
makes the content hash mean anything — so embedding happens on delivery, not before.

## What is deliberately not here

Everything PRODUCT.md defers: attribution links, `/r/{code}`, the disclosure gate,
leaderboards, rewards, composite sessions, K-factor. Those are role 2, and they are
what would force a relational database. Their absence is why there is no database tier.

Also absent by design: a websocket (kit status polls one row every 3s), a CDN, and a
"which archetype goes viral" recommender — research calls that folklore.
