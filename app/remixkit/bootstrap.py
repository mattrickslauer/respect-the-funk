"""Load secrets from SSM into the environment, before settings are read.

Terraform creates the parameters but deliberately never holds their values — putting a
B2 application key into Terraform state would store it in plaintext. So the values are
set out of band, and something has to fetch them at runtime. This is that something.

It must run **before** the first `get_settings()` call, because that is `lru_cache`d and
whatever the environment looked like at that moment is what the process believes
forever. Hence a plain function called at the top of `create_app()` and the worker's
`main()`, rather than a FastAPI dependency or a startup hook.

Names map straight across: the parameter `/remixkit/prod/B2_APP_KEY` becomes the
environment variable `RK_B2_APP_KEY`, so a value that arrives via SSM in production and
via `.env` on a laptop is read by the same settings field either way. Provider keys
that Genblaze reads directly from the environment (`GMI_API_KEY`, `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`)
are additionally exported unprefixed, because those are read by the library, not by us.

Failure is fatal on purpose. A process that cannot read its credentials should not come
up and serve errors; it should refuse to start, where a deployment notices.
