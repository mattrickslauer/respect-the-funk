"""Sending mail — a port, because the console must work with no mail credentials.

There is exactly one thing the app sends today (a sign-in code), and exactly one thing
it needs to know about the outcome: whether the message actually left the building.
That boolean is load-bearing. A sign-in flow that says "check your email" when nothing
was sent is worse than one that refuses, so `send()` returns delivery rather than
raising, and the caller decides what to tell the user.

Two adapters, same shape as every other port here: `mailer_console` (log it, report
`delivered=False`) is the zero-credential path, `mailer_zepto` is production.
