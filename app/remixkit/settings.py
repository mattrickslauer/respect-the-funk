"""Configuration — one object, env-driven, with defaults that run on a laptop.

The four `*_backend` fields are the whole deployment story. Each selects an adapter
behind a port; the defaults are the zero-credential path, and every production value
is additive rather than a rewrite:

    storage_backend    local  → b2
    generator_backend  mock   → genblaze
    queue_backend      inline → sqs
    auth_backend       none   → otp
    mail_backend       console → zeptomail

`RK_` prefixes everything so these never collide with the provider keys Genblaze reads
directly from the environment (`GMI_API_KEY`, `B2_KEY_ID`, …).
