"""The console.

Server-rendered Jinja + htmx, in the same FastAPI app — BUILD-SPEC §2's frontend
decision and web/README's stated precedent, which resolves open decision §13.5.

"Componentized" here means every fragment under `templates/components/` renders
standalone and is addressable by a route that returns *just that fragment*. htmx swaps
them in place. So the same `_kit_row.html` is used by the full page render, by the
create-kit response, and by the status poll — one definition, three call sites. If this
is later replaced by a React or Next.js front end, these routes are already the
component boundaries, and `api/v1.py` is already the JSON to drive them.

Every handler resolves a `Principal` even though nothing is authenticated, so the
tenant it reads is the tenant a real login would supply.

    On B2 the browser gets a presigned URL and this route is never reached — which is
    the whole point of rule 2. It exists so the console shows real generated assets on
    a laptop instead of broken images.

    It takes a `Principal` for the same reason every other route does, and here it is
    load-bearing rather than ceremonial: this handler reads an arbitrary object key out
    of the URL, so leaving it open would have made it the one way around the login —
    fetch the bytes directly and skip the page that would have asked who you are.

    Documents are refused, signed in or not. The YAML under `tenants/` is the repository's
    private storage — accounts, artists, kits — and nothing in the console ever links to
    it, so refusing it costs no legitimate fetch.

    The *prefix* used to be refused, though, and that claim was true when it was written
    and quietly stopped being true. Identity reference frames live under
    `tenants/{tenant}/identities/{id}/frames/`, and the identity page links to every one of
    them — so a laptop on local storage rendered an artist with five broken images while
    the bytes sat on disk. Nobody saw it on B2, where those frames are presigned and this
    route is never reached, which is exactly how a dev-only path rots.

    So the rule is what it always meant: not *this prefix*, but *documents, and other
    people's things*. A tenant's media is served to that tenant and nobody else — the
    handler takes an arbitrary key from the URL, so without the ownership check a signed-in
    user of one tenant could read another's photographs by typing the path. `runs/` and
