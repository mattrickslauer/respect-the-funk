        The same shape as `_mcp_missing` on the Ask screen, and for the same reason:
        "billing is not configured" is not an actionable message, and this needs four
        things. Naming them is the difference between a refusal somebody fixes in a
        minute and one they file a bug about.

        A list rather than a formatted sentence, because two surfaces render it — the
        checkout refusal as JSON, and the pricing page as prose — and a pre-formatted
        string would force one of them to parse English.

        **Which four it needs depends on the mode**, and the mode comes off the key. A
        deployment holding a test key is not missing `STRIPE_PRICE_LABEL_LIVE`; it has no
        use for it. Naming both pairs unconditionally would send an operator to create
        live products in order to fix a test-mode deployment, which is the opposite of
        the thing this property exists to prevent.

        deliberate choice and the one place in this property where a mode is assumed, so
        it is worth defending: the state it describes is a deployment being set up, set-up
        starts in test mode, and the alternative is telling somebody with an empty `.env`
        that they need two variables when they in fact need four. Naming both pairs would
        be worse still — it would send them to create live products before they had a test
        checkout working.

        The assumption is safe because it only affects *reporting*. `stripe_configured`
        answers False on an unrecognised mode regardless of this list, and
        `billing.require_configured` distinguishes an unset key from a malformed one
