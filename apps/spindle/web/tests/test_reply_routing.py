"""The address a reply is asked to come back to, and who is allowed to change it.

`040_mailbox.sql` builds the table and `inbound.py` reads a token out of an arriving
message. This file covers the other end: the token has to *get onto the wire* in the
first place, as a plus-addressed `Reply-To` on the pitch itself, or rung one of the
correlation ladder never fires and every reply falls through to the weaker rungs.

The tier half is here too, because it is the same decision seen from the product side:
whose address a pitch goes out from is what a tenant is paying for when they connect a
mailbox, and the free tier's answer is "the platform's".
