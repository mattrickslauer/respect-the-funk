# The platform console, as cheaply as AWS can be made to run a web app.
#
# Idle cost: $0.00. Not "under a dollar" — zero. Every line below is chosen to
# keep it there, and each omission is deliberate rather than forgotten:
#
#   * No API Gateway. A Lambda Function URL does the same job for a server-rendered
#     app and costs nothing per request. API Gateway is ~$1.00/million on top of
#     Lambda for routing we are not using.
#   * No VPC, and therefore no NAT gateway. A NAT is ~$32/month of pure idle floor,
#     which is more than everything else here combined, forever, whether or not
#     anyone visits. The Lambda reaches CockroachDB over the public internet with
#     verify-full TLS, which is how CockroachDB Cloud expects to be reached anyway.
#     (infra/README.md makes this same argument for the RemixKit stack.)
#   * No Secrets Manager. $0.40/secret/month for two secrets, when Lambda
#     environment variables are already encrypted at rest with an AWS-managed KMS
#     key at no charge. Revisit when something needs rotation without a deploy.
#   * No ECR. A zip deployment avoids per-GB image storage entirely.
#
# The list used to carry a fourth entry — "No CloudFront, no custom domain, no ACM. The
# Function URL is a working HTTPS endpoint. A domain is a $12/year decision to take when
# there is something worth pointing it at." **That decision was taken on 2026-08-16** and
# `domain.tf` is the result; what made it worth taking was outbound mail, which pays a
# deliverability cost on every send that carries an opaque `*.on.aws` link. CloudFront
# itself stays inside its perpetual free tier at this volume (1TB out, 10M requests a
# month) and ACM certificates are free, so the compute story above is unchanged.
#
# Idle cost is therefore no longer exactly $0.00. It is **$0.50/month**, all of it the
# Route 53 hosted zone `dns.tf` creates. That is the honest number and it is stated here
# rather than left to contradict the opening line.
#
# What does cost money, eventually: Lambda invocations beyond the free tier
# (1M requests + 400k GB-seconds per month, which this will not approach), and
# CloudWatch log ingestion, capped below by a 7-day retention.

  # plan of 23 to add and 22 to destroy, which would have meant
  #
  #   * a **new Function URL** — `console_url` is the deployed address, and the old one
  #     stops answering the moment the Lambda is replaced;
  #   * a **replaced masters bucket**. `aws_s3_bucket.masters` has no `force_destroy` and
  #     the live bucket is not empty, so the destroy fails with `BucketNotEmpty` — *after*

#      There is no third option and no way to skip it.
#   2. **A new SES account is in the sandbox**, which will only deliver to addresses that
#      have themselves been verified. That is a support request with a turnaround, it
#      cannot be expressed as a resource, and until it clears **sign-in works only for
#      addresses verified in the AWS console.** On a deployment where sign-in is the only

# The console may send, and only from the verified identity. Scoped to the identity ARN
# rather than "*" so a bug — or a stolen set of credentials — cannot send as a domain this
# deployment does not own, which is the difference between an incident and a spam
# incident somebody else's reputation pays for.
# A custom MAIL FROM subdomain, which is the only thing that makes SPF *align*.
#
# ## Why this exists, and why adding `include:amazonses.com` to SPF would not have worked
#
# Sign-in codes landed in Gmail's spam folder on 2026-08-15. DKIM was verified, aligned
# and passing, so DMARC passed on the DKIM half — but SPF did not align, and that is a
# real negative signal rather than a cosmetic one.
#
# The reason is the *envelope* sender. Without a custom MAIL FROM, SES sends with a
# Return-Path at `*.amazonses.com`, so the receiver's SPF check authenticates
# **amazonses.com** — which passes, and is a different domain from the one in the `From`
# header. DMARC only counts SPF when the two align. This is the standard trap: putting
# `include:amazonses.com` in mattrickslauer.com's SPF record changes nothing, because
# that record is never the one consulted.
#
# Setting a MAIL FROM subdomain moves the Return-Path to `bounce.<domain>`, which does
# align, and the SPF record published there is then the one that is checked.
#
# ## `UseDefaultValue`, deliberately
#
# `RejectMessage` is the stricter setting and it is the wrong one to apply here first.
# The DNS for this domain is at the registrar, not in Route 53, so the two records below
# have to be added by hand — and between this resource applying and those records
# existing, `RejectMessage` would refuse **every** send. On a deployment where an emailed
# code is the only credential, that is a self-inflicted lockout in the window where
# somebody is least likely to be watching.
#
# With `UseDefaultValue`, SES falls back to `*.amazonses.com` until the records resolve:
# exactly today's behaviour, no worse, and it upgrades itself the moment DNS is right.
# Tighten to `RejectMessage` once `aws ses get-identity-mail-from-domain-attributes`
# reports `Success` — that is a one-line change and it is worth making, because at that
# point a fallback to an unaligned envelope is a silent regression of this whole fix.
#
# The records to add are `terraform output ses_mail_from_records`; the runbook has them

# ------------------------------------------------------------------- changefeed
#
# The webhook sink for `CREATE CHANGEFEED FOR TABLE thread, outbox, message`. This is the
# endpoint that makes `infra/platform_architecture.py`'s dashed arrow — "a changefeed
# wakes an agent" — a true sentence rather than a drawing of an intention. As of the
# 2026-08-10 audit, `SHOW CHANGEFEED JOBS` returned zero rows.
#
# `spindle/changefeed.py` is the whole of it; read that module's docstring before
# changing anything here. Two facts this stack has to respect:
#
#   * A wake is permission to look, not a grant of work. This function receives a batch,
#     turns it into "there may be claimable leads of these kinds in this tenant", and
#     calls `fleet.work_once`, which claims under a lease token exactly as every other
#     worker does. Webhook sinks are at-least-once by specification; two invocations for
#     one row change are normal, and they produce one unit of work because of the claim,
#     not because of anything in this file.
#   * Creating the changefeed itself is NOT done here. A changefeed is a job that draws
#     request units continuously against a $10 budget, and this stack has no CockroachDB
#     provider. `python -m spindle.changefeed --dry-run` prints the exact statement;
#     a human runs it once the URL below exists and the budget has been checked.
#
# Same zip as the console — `data.archive_file.bundle` already contains `spindle` —
# so this adds a function and not a build step. Idle cost is zero for the reasons argued
# at the top of this file. Cost in use is one invocation per *batch*, because the feed is
# created with `webhook_sink_config` flushing at 50 messages or 5 seconds, plus one
# invocation per `resolved` heartbeat (every 5 minutes, 288 a day, answered without a
# database connection).

# Logs and nothing else. This function claims leads and runs agents; the one agent a wake
# can reach today (`distil_lesson`) talks to an embedding provider over HTTPS with a key
# from the environment and needs no AWS authority at all.
#
# The Sender is deliberately NOT reachable from here: no PLATFORM_MAIL_* variables are set
# on *this* function, so `settings.mail_configured` is false in the changefeed and
# `changefeed.lambda_handler` reports an outbox wake as "no sender attached" rather than
# mailing a curator because a row appeared. `ingest.py` keeps `--send` separate from
# draining for that reason and a changefeed must not quietly undo it.
#
# **This note used to end "wiring SES here is a decision to take on purpose". That decision
# was taken on 2026-08-15, and only half of it.** SES is now wired to the *console*
# function, because email-OTP sign-in made mail the only way anybody gets in. It is
# deliberately not wired here, and the distinction is the whole point of leaving this
# paragraph rather than deleting it: a person signing in asks for the message they are
# about to receive, and a curator does not. The console may send because a human just
# clicked; the changefeed may not send because a row appeared.
