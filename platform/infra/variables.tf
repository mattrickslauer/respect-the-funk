# nothing could mail a curator by accident. Email-OTP sign-in changes the stakes: a
# deployment with no verified SES identity is one nobody can enter, because `otp.py`
# refuses to issue a code rather than falling back to showing one.
#
# All four default to empty, and empty is still a legitimate state — it plans and applies
# cleanly, creates no SES resources, and yields a console whose sign-in page names the
# three variables it needs. What it does not do is pretend.
