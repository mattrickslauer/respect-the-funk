"""The sign-in routes and the account page, as the console actually serves them.

    python -m unittest discover platform/web/tests

`test_otp.py` proves the challenge; this proves the two routes that use it, the cookie
they set, and the page they land on. Handlers are called directly rather than through a
client, which is the house style here and the reason `_request` exists.

The properties this file is for:

  * **The order of the two calls in `signin_verify`.** `otp.verify_code` runs before
    `accounts.sign_in`, and if that ever reverses, typing any address into the form
    creates an account for it. That is the whole security property of the flow, and it is
    one line, so it is asserted by behaviour rather than trusted to review.
  * **The session cookie's flags.** httpOnly, secure, lax, ninety days. Four values that
    are individually easy to drop and invisible when dropped.
  * **The account page offers no control for anything unbuilt** — no email change, no
    device list. A box that silently does nothing is worse than a sentence saying why
    there is no box.
